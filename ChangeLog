  * Server really works (e.g. sends messages). This is the time to measure
    its performance and to speed it up.

  * Plugin which reads messages from stdin is implemented.

    sucks as well!).

  * m4 scripts was improved to work on various platforms

  * Notifications when connection opens or closes were implemented and
    tested.

  * Node-based STL containers now use single-threaded free-list allocator.

    boost::multi_index to support multiple connection from one user.

  * Small refactoring was done to ensure that every translation unit
    can be compiled itself.
